D-Dimer assays from the multitude of independant hospitals/laboratories are analysed below.

The number of available samples from each of the cohorts and the observed assays are summarised in the tables below by recruitment group and primary classification based on case review.


```{r ddimer_summary, , echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10, results = 'markup', eval = FALSE}
dipep_summarise(df           = dipep,
                grouping     = 'group',
                group.as.col = TRUE,
                exclude               = NULL,
                exclude.non.recruited = FALSE,
                exclude.dvt           = FALSE,
                exclude.anti.coag     = FALSE,
                exclude.missing       = FALSE,
                d.dimer) %>%
    dplyr::select(-Measurement) %>%
    kable(caption = 'D-Dimer assays recorded at hospital by recruitment group.')

dipep_summarise(df           = dipep,
                grouping     = 'first.st',
                group.as.col = TRUE,
                exclude               = NULL,
                exclude.non.recruited = TRUE,
                exclude.dvt           = TRUE,
                exclude.anti.coag     = FALSE,
                exclude.missing       = FALSE,
                d.dimer) %>%
    dplyr::select(-Measurement) %>%
    kable(caption = 'D-Dimer assays recorded at hospital by recruitment Primary case review allocation. Excludes Non-recruited cohort.')

```

The site specific 'reference ranges' (i.e. the nth percentile) were used to classify each measurement into 'Normal'  if it was within the recorded range or 'Abnormal' if it is outside the recorded range and this dichotomised variable is used to assess the predictive value of the D-Dimer assays.  There were `r missing.d.dimer.high` individuals from the UKOSS cohort who had a recorded D-Dimer assay but for whom the reference range was not recorded.  These individuals are therefore excluded from subsequent analyses as they can not be classified.
