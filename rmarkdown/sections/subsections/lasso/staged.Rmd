##### Staged Models

When a person presents at hospital or Accident & Emergency the amount of information available to the triaging clinician will be variable.  Some patients may be fully aware and able to answer questions, whilst others may be unconcious.  To this end a sensible strategy is to develop a series of models based on available information, starting with physiological variables that will be available to all, then augmenting it with information that may be available from a persons medical records and assays from putative biomarkers before finally including responses to the questions included in this study.
