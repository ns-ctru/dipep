#### PERC Score

The PERC Score for study participants (@kline2004) is summarised below.  It should be noted that the PERC score is designed to be used when a diagnosis of PE is being considered but the risk is low (as described in the [online calculator](http://www.mdcalc.com/perc-rule-pulmonary-embolism/)).  A PERC Score $>= 1$ is taken as indicative of PE.
