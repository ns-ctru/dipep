A detailed description of the rationale and design of this study is beyond the scope of this statistical report.  Readers are referred to the Study Protocol (v6_02Mar16 as of writing) for a detailed description.

The aim of the current work is to develop and test alternative methods for determining whether females who are pregnant who present with certain physiological symptoms are at risk of experiencing [pulmonary embolisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary\_embolism) where an artery in the lung becomes blocked by a substance/body transported from elsewhere in the body.  Case-control data has been collected retrospectively on individuals who presented with symptoms and were suspected of having pulmonary embolisms.  Only a portion of these went on to have the condition confirmed (cases) the remainder are controls.  A number of different statistical approaches are to be used to build predictive models of the risk of embolisms based on clinical knowledge of what features are considered high risk.  Once derived the models are to be validated internally via [leave one out cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation\_(statistics)#Leave-one-out_cross-validation) assessed for [sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity\_and\_specificity), the [positive and negative predictive value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive\_and\_negative\_predictive\_values) and the [area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver\_operating\_characteristic).

The different models will then be assessed for the subsequent Health Economics performance in terms of the expected utilisation of resources and the associated costs.
